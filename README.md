# this-weekend
ephemeral messaging and group chat app. Who do you want to be this weekend?

The weekend doesn't last forever, so why should your message history?

This app lets you choose who you want to be each weekend. Your handle expires after 3 days.

Then, you can create rooms, or join rooms others have invited you to. Chat all you want for three days.

After that, it's all in your memory. Talk about it all you want, but there's no paper trail.
